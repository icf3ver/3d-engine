# My 3D Engine
A 3D engine made with ggez in rust.

WARNING: This program may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.

## Description
This is a 3D engine made with ggez and rust. I decided to make this project because I have always found the concept of 3D projection baffeling and wanted to understand it.

NOTE: At the moment this program does all the calculations on the CPU...

## Versions
### v0.1.0
Basic Working algorithm for rendering 3d models.

### v0.2.0
Implements Multithreading
Better projection Algorithm
Crop triangles to fit screen
Better comments.

### v0.3.0
Changed movement to be more intuitive
Compensate for reversed y axis
Better render culling
Cleaner code

## Todo
 ### Bug Fix
 - Fix diagonal turning mirror error
 - Fix the big triangles glitch
 - Clipping stack overflow error
 - <!> Clean lighting <!>
 ### UI
  + Export Stl and Obj
  + Object manipulation
   - Rotation
   - Movement
   - Scale
  + Vertex manipulation
  + divide sides
  + background manipulation
  + Lock look
  + vertex mode
